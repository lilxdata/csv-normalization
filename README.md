# csv-normalization

to run on a mac: 
1. install python3
2. install pip 
3. pip install pandas
4. run the following on command line: "python3 csv-norm.py *sample.csv*" where sample.csv is the file you would like to perform transformations on. 

some notes: 
1. sample.csv needs to be in same folder as csv-norm.py
2. output file will be in output.csv

future work: 
1. error handling
2. replace invalid characters with unicode replacement character 
3. make sure time stamps are in iso-8601
4. clean up comments and organize code // refactor
